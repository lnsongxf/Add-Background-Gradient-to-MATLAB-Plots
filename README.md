# Add Background Gradient to MATLAB Plots
The picture pretty much says it all. This is a simple function for adding a nice looking background gradient on your plots. It's useful for making things look a little fancy.
Note: The author does not condone the fancification of plots to make up for a complete lack of substance!

Good luck :)
